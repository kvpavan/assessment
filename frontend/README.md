# Assessment Frontend
### **Basic Local Setup**

*Prerequisites*

1. Ensure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and updated on you machine.  Check current version with command `node -v` and that it is v10.16.0 or greater.

*Running Results locally*

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2. `cd` into project directory.
3. run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. run `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

*Additional Commands*

1. `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

2. `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!  Due to this please discuss with Pavan or another project maintainer before changing build tools and configuration. **

If we aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, we can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from the project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into the project so we have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.
